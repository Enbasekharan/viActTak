<!-- viAct Task for Front End Developer -->

<!-- Done by Enbasekharan M -->



Instruction to review the project:

firts rum Npm commands to install dependencies,

npm init

then 

npm install

then start my project in local host

npm start




Notes:

1. Completely done without any external UI library

2. used custom hook and useContext hook in context.js file to get my state throughout my project

3. used useReducer in context.js to handle various functions

4. App.js contains three three sub components

5. just used action.js to convert reducer type string into variable which will reduce typo mistakes.

6. Search form component contations 'search-input' as well as 'sort-by-date' input

7. Stories components contains 10 articles per page form a API

8. Buttons component contains all the buttons to navigate between pages

9. News Api allows 100 requests per day/ so kindly change the api key if the limit exceeds

Thanks
